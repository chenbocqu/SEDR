########  Installation will require CVX (not included) ################
CVX can be obtained from :
http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/

CVX needs to be in your path before you start using this file
Once CVX is installed
Add the SRC folder to your path.
Then run SRC by calling the following function

[predictions,src_scores,uniqlabels]=src(Traindata,Trainlabels,Testdata,sp_level)


See example.m for a dry run
Can handle multiple label classifications
Works almost as good as SVM on binary classifications of high dimensional datasets

########## ABOUT###########################
#The kernel sparse representations classifier implemented here was developed as a part of the work towards the paper
 
1) Gaonkar, Bilwaj, and Christos Davatzikos. "Analytic estimation of statistical significance maps for support vector machine based multi-variate image analysis and classification." NeuroImage 78 (2013): 270-283.

and is based on the paper:

 2)Robust Face Recgnition via Sparse Representation John Wright, Student Member, Allen Y. Yang, Member, Arvind Ganesh, Student Member,
S. Shankar Sastry, Fellow, and Yi Ma, Senior Member.


#Please cite both papers in your work appropriately
# I have modified it sufficiently to solve things in kernel space
# as opposed to the original classifier which was in feature space
